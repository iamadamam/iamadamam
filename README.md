- 👋 Hi, I’m @iamadamam
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, particuarly Java and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java through the Open University as part of working towards a BSc (Hons) Computing and IT (Software)
- 👽 Trying to make coding a habit and do a little bit daily. Finding it difficult to stick to a routine and find myself procrastinating a lot! 
- 🤝 Feel free to reach out to me if you have any tips, advice or are in a similar situation and just want to chat!
